** Scoreboard Algorithm(计分板算法)
/CPI/ cycles per instruction
*** Centrailized control
Issue -> Read Operands -> Execution -> Write result

*** Parts to the Scoreboard
+ Instruction status
+ Functional Unit status: 9 fields

** Tomasulo Algorithm
+ For IBM 360/91 (before cashes)
  => Long memory latecy
+ Goal: High Performace without special compilers
+ 限制了编译器调度的有效性

+ Results to FU from RS, not through registers, over Common Data Bus that broadcasts results to all PUs
  + Avoids RAWhazards by executing an instrction only when its operands are available
+  Load and Sotre treated as FUs with RSs as well
+ Interger instrctions can go past branches allowing FP ops beyond basic block in FP queue
** Reservation Station Components
*** Three Stages of Tomasulo Algorithm
+ Issue
+ Execute
+ Write result
