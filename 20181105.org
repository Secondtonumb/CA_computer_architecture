* Lecture 9 Multiprocessing
+ parallel computer architecture
  + other factors => multiprocessors
  + 并不是一个很新的技术，由于各种各样的原因没有流行起来
  + Flynn分类法
    + SISD ->data level parelleism
    + SIMD ->
    + MISD -> precess level paralleism
    + MIMD
** Why Vector Processors
+ A single vector instrction specifies a great deal of work - it is equivalent to executing an entire loop
+ The computation of each result for one element in the vector is indpendent of he computation of other
+ Two primary types of architextures for vactor processors:
+ vector-register
+ Vector Memory-Meory vs. Vector Register Machines
+ Vector memory-memory architecturs(VMMA) require grater main memory bandwidth
  + All operand must be read in and out of memory
+ -> ignore vector memory-memory method
** The basic structure of a vector-register architecture 
** Multimedia Extensions aka SIMD extensions
+ Automatic Code Vectorization
